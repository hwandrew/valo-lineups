# Valo-Lineups Server

## Getting Started

Clone & run `npm install` or `yarn` to download the necessary dependencies

### Initializing the database

TODO

### Hosting the database locally

- Run `npm run dbon` or `yarn dbon` to begin hosting

### Hosting a local server

- Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to begin hosting on port 3001
- Navigate to `localhost:3001/api`

### Making changes

This project uses `nodemon` to allow for reactive updates whenever project files are changed. Once a server is hosted, there should be no need to kill the process until you're done!
